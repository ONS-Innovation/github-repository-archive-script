# Logging

When the tool gets deployed to AWS, a CloudWatch log group is created to capture all logs generated by the application. The logs contain which repositories are being processed, the status of each processing step, and any errors that occur.

Once the tool has finished an execution, it will log:

- A list of repositories that have been archived.
- A list of repositories that have had issues created for them.
- The total number of repositories processed.
- The total number of repositories that were successfully archived.
- The total number of repositories that had issues created.

Logs are kept for a period of 90 days by default. This is defined within the tool's Terraform variables (See `log_retention_days` within `terraform/service/variables.tf`).
