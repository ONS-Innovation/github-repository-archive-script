# Note: 
# Within docker, this container runs as root as no user is specified.
# Due to the nature of the lambda function, this is acceptable as Lambda defines the default user
# to have the least-privilege permissions rather than the root user.

# Therefore we can ignore the linting error for this Dockerfile
# as it is not a security risk for this specific use case.

# Ignored in .trivyignore also.
